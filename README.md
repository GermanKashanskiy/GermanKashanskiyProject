Description

Welcome to my portfolio! This site was designed to showcase my web development skills and projects. 
Here you will find examples of my work including websites, apps and other projects realized using HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

Technologies

HTML: The site is structured using the latest HTML5 standards.

CSS: The website is styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), providing an adaptive and modern design.

SASS: The SASS preprocessor was used to simplify and optimize styling, allowing the use of variables, mixins and nesting.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap framework was used to create responsive design, simplify component styling, and ensure compatibility across devices and browsers.

JavaScript: JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the site.
